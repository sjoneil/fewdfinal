FEWD Final Project

The following components are a part of this final project:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript (OK not a ton, but it's there!)
4. HTML 5 Classes
5. Classes / IDs
6. Inline-Block Elements
7. Compatible with a Mobile Device

WINS: 
#1 and #2. 
Specifically, I felt that CSS was the easiest part and I enjoyed working with it the most. I discovered Visible and Hidden vales and truly loved manipulating sections of HTML with a single line of code.

LOSSES:
#3 and #4.
JavaScript in its entirety is something I'm just not getting at this point, but I intend to keep practicing and learning. I basically have nice looking, non-functional pages at this point!
